[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a famous project where participants show what they can achieve through css alone.

Without editing the html, developers use css to show how the same content can be styled and structured in very different ways.

Have a go at creating a css file to see what you can come up with!

## Getting started

Open a terminal and `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to start a live server. Create your css file and have fun hacking!
